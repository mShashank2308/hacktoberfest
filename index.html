      <h4><strong>Giyu Tomioka</strong></h4>
      <p>Giyu is known in the anime community as the “Depression King” for his reserved personality and serious but
        emotionless facial expressions. Although he’s not a bad guy or rude towards anyone, none of the Hashiras like
        his company still Giyu stays true to his introverted nature. Some part of his social incompetency comes from
        his emotional past as well.

        However, keeping his personality aside, Giyu is a very competent and skilled swordsman, and his Hashira status
        is a testament to his genius swordsmanship. Being a Water Hashira, he is capable of unleashing the eleventh
        form “Dead Calm” which is one of the most powerful attacks in the series. Even Upper-Rank Three, Akaza noted
        his extraordinary techniques and acknowledged him as one of the greatest Water Hashira he ever fought.</p>

      <h4><strong>Douma</strong></h4>
      <p>Douma made his first appearance at the end of Demon Slayer Season 2 and the mere glance of his was more than
        enough to tell about his female fetish. As the Upper-Rank Two, he clearly is the third strongest demon out
        there right behind Kokushibo and Muzan. Although there is only a difference of one rank between him and Akaza,
        his power level is exponentially greater as such his martial arts skill surpasses Akaza’s bare-fisted combat
        prowess

        Douma’s Blood Demon Art, Cryokinesis, allows him to unleash a range of potent ice-based techniques for both
        offense and defense. Additionally, the ice created from his Blood Demon Art is extremely lethal to those that
        inhale it, causing the cells of the victim’s lungs to die and rendering them unable to breathe very quickly.
        Douma wields this technique with near-perfect accuracy without getting tired in the battle.</p>
