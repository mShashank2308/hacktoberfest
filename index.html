        <h4><strong>Makomo</strong></h4>
        <p>Makomo was a young girl of a short stature with pale skin, who possessed gentle eyes of a deep cyan color, their pupils rectangular and white, that were a notably paler turquoise near the bottom. She had black hair that came down to her shoulders, spiking outwards at the ends, and short micro bangs over her forehead.

          Completely opposing to Sabito's aggressive personality, Makomo was a girl of quiet, patient and kind nature. She was always helping Tanjiro Kamado by pointing out any mistakes in his technique and correcting any bad habits he had unconsciously developed during his training under Sakonji. Makomo's pet phrase is that she loves Sakonji very much.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h4><strong>Giyu Tomioka</strong></h4>
        <p>Giyu is known in the anime community as the “Depression King” for his reserved personality and serious but
          emotionless facial expressions. Although he’s not a bad guy or rude towards anyone, none of the Hashiras like
          his company still Giyu stays true to his introverted nature. Some part of his social incompetency comes from
          his emotional past as well.

          However, keeping his personality aside, Giyu is a very competent and skilled swordsman, and his Hashira status
          is a testament to his genius swordsmanship. Being a Water Hashira, he is capable of unleashing the eleventh
          form “Dead Calm” which is one of the most powerful attacks in the series. Even Upper-Rank Three, Akaza noted
          his extraordinary techniques and acknowledged him as one of the greatest Water Hashira he ever fought.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h4><strong>Douma</strong></h4>
        <p>Douma made his first appearance at the end of Demon Slayer Season 2 and the mere glance of his was more than
          enough to tell about his female fetish. As the Upper-Rank Two, he clearly is the third strongest demon out
          there right behind Kokushibo and Muzan. Although there is only a difference of one rank between him and Akaza,
          his power level is exponentially greater as such his martial arts skill surpasses Akaza’s bare-fisted combat
          prowess

          Douma’s Blood Demon Art, Cryokinesis, allows him to unleash a range of potent ice-based techniques for both
          offense and defense. Additionally, the ice created from his Blood Demon Art is extremely lethal to those that
          inhale it, causing the cells of the victim’s lungs to die and rendering them unable to breathe very quickly.
          Douma wields this technique with near-perfect accuracy without getting tired in the battle.</p>

          <p>
            Kyojuro Rengoku (煉れん獄ごく 杏きょう寿じゅ郎ろう Rengoku Kyōjurō) was an enthusiastic hashira who came across as
            cheerfully eccentric. He was a Demon Slayer of the Demon Slayer Corps and the late Flame Hashira (炎えん柱ばしら En
            Bashira). He was pure of heart and excellent in swordsmanship. His fight with Akaza the Upper Third demon is
            one that is relished by Anime Fans all over.

            Zenitsu comes off as a coward, as he often claims that he doesn't have long to live due to the dangerous job
            of being a Demon Slayer. He also has rather low self-esteem despite his strength, even considering himself
            useless as seen when he couldn't believe he had slain a demon and tricked himself into instead believing
            that it was Shoichi
